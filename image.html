            <p>The image I chose to describe was the image of our beloved Breslin Center. This is where our basketball teams play and where students go to enjoy the games with thier friends. The Breslin Center first opened in 1989 and is named after Jack Breslin. The stadium can hold up to 16,280 guests. This arena is also home to many other events including commencement for seniors, large concerts, performances of all kinds, and there was even a monster truck show there in the past. For most students the Breslin is on their MSU bucket list, and I believe that every student should visit it at least once in their time here at MSU.</p>
